# Chapter 1: Ash and Echoes

## Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1492 DR

The morning sun peeked over the Greypeak Mountains, turning the sky a soft gold. But the light only made the scene in front of the five travelers feel sadder.
The village of Oakhurst—once full of laughter and the smell of baking bread—was now nothing but smoke and ash. Blackened wood stuck up from the ground like broken teeth, and the air smelled of burnt grain.

Five companions stood together, looking at what was left.

The Companions

Kaelen Virethorn, a high elf paladin of Torm, stood tall in shining armor with the golden hand of his god on his chest. His silver hair caught the sunlight, but his amber eyes were full of concern.

Bramble Thistlewhip, a Lightfoot halfling rogue, was small, quick, and always ready with a joke—even now, though her green eyes searched the rubble for any sign of survivors.

Thorn of the Emberfall, a tiefling sorcerer, had crimson skin, black horns, and eyes that glowed faintly red. His cloak smelled faintly of smoke—not from Oakhurst, but from the magic that sometimes flared from his hands.

Durik Stoneguard, a dwarven cleric of Moradin, wore heavy armor scratched from many battles. His auburn beard was braided neatly, and his strong hands were as ready to heal as they were to fight.

Selene Mistral, a human ranger with sharp green eyes, stood with her falcon Ashwing perched on her arm. She was quiet, but her gaze missed nothing.

Kaelen knelt near the ruins of the village’s small shrine to Chauntea. The goddess’s statue lay in pieces.
“This wasn’t an accident,” he said, his voice low. “Someone did this on purpose.”

Durik kicked at a fallen beam, revealing a blackened mark burned into the wood.
“I know this sign. The Circle of Thorns. Cultists. They’ve been raiding villages in the South.”

Selene crouched beside him, holding a scrap of scorched parchment. A weeping tree wrapped in spiked vines was drawn on it.
“They’re heading west,” she said. “And always near the old magic roads.”

“They’re taking people too,” Bramble added, brushing soot from her hands. She had just helped a frightened old farmer to safety. “Not just stealing—kidnapping.”

Thorn’s fingers sparked faintly. “This magic… it’s cruel. Old. I can still feel it in the air.”

Kaelen stood, his armor catching the light. “Then we follow them. We bring the stolen home.”

That evening, the five stayed in Oakhurst. They buried the fallen and tended to the injured. No one asked for payment. No one thought of leaving.

When the last grave was filled, they gathered by a small fire at the village edge. The only surviving child, wrapped in Selene’s cloak, slept beside Ashwing, who kept watch.

Bramble poked at the fire. “We’re probably outnumbered.”

Kaelen smiled faintly. “When hasn’t that been true?”

Durik grunted. “We’ve got something they don’t—each other.”

Thorn nodded slowly. “And a cause worth burning for.”

Selene looked at them all. “Then we don’t stop. Not until the Circle of Thorns is gone.”

They raised their mugs—just water this time—and drank together.
Not to glory. Not to victory.

*To each other.*
